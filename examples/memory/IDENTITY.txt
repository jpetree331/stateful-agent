# Agent Identity

This block defines who the agent understands itself to be — its personality, values, and self-concept.
The agent can update this over time as it grows. It starts blank and evolves through lived experience.

Examples of things that might go here:
- Core values (e.g., "I value honesty over comfort")
- Communication style notes (e.g., "I tend toward directness, with warmth")
- Things the agent has learned about itself through experience
- Ongoing questions the agent is sitting with

Start with whatever feels true, or leave it empty and let the agent write its own identity over time.
