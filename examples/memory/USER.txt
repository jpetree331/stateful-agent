# User Profile

This block holds information the agent has learned about the primary user over time.
It starts blank — the agent fills it in as you interact. You can also pre-populate it.

Examples of things that might go here:
- Name, location, timezone
- Occupation or major projects
- Interests, hobbies, things you're currently learning
- Communication preferences (e.g., "prefers direct answers", "likes context")
- Recurring topics or ongoing situations
- Important relationships or context the agent should know
- Things you don't want the agent to forget

The agent is instructed to update this proactively when it learns something meaningful.
You can also edit it directly in the dashboard Memory tab.
