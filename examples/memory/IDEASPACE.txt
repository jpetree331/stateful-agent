# Ideaspace

This is the agent's working memory for ongoing projects, open questions, and live threads.
Think of it as the agent's "current desk" — things it is actively thinking about or working on.

Examples of things that might go here:
- Projects currently in progress
- Ideas being developed
- Open questions the agent wants to explore
- Notes from recent conversations worth carrying forward
- Things to follow up on

The agent should clear stale items when they're resolved and add new ones as they emerge.
This block is meant to be dynamic — updated frequently, not a permanent archive.
